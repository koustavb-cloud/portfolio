    <p>
      I'm Koustav Bhasin, a 2nd year Mechatronics student @ the University of Waterloo with a deep interest in automotive systems, mechanical design and manufacturing. I've contributed to design teams like Formula Electric and taken initiative on personal projects, where I've explored drivetrain and chassis design, faced complex manufacturing challenges (partially for cost-reduction purposes) and strengthened my problem-solving abilities in the process. My growing skill set includes CAD modelling (primarily using SolidWorks, AutoCAD and N-X), basic ANSYS analysis, precision machining and mechanical system integration.

    <h2>üèéÔ∏è Project: Combustion Go-Kart Build</h2>
    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A group project to design and assemble a functioning go-kart powered by a small combustion engine. The goal was to explore hands-on vehicle and chassis design, 
      gain practical CAD, machining and system integration knowledge. This project emphasized problem-solving and learning through iterations rather than following a pre-defined plan (which would've been more useful)</p>
    <p><strong>What we did:</p>
      <li>Design the chassis and basic model assembly on OnShape</li>
      <li>Learned how to weld in order to be able to manufacture the chassis ourselves and save costs.</li>
      <li>Installed a 255cc 4 stroke engine paired with a CVT to maximise torque output and fuel efficiency. 
        Decision was made due to the fact that their was a huge weight balance on the car</li>
      <li>Used bike brake cables to for throttle control and to implement a mechanical brake system</li>
      <li>Showcased at Socratica Symposium in Waterloo, along with 70+ creators, with 1000+ in attendance</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Problem we ran into:</p>
      <li>A lot of overwelds, which meant grinding them down afterwards to give A) a clean look, and 
        B) reduce any residual stresses caused by the overwelds</li>
      <li>A recurring issue was the alignment for the engine sprocket and drive chain sprocket. Due to the absence of a positive-locking mechanism, the drive chain sprocket would misalign and shift while driving. In hindsight, a more permanent solution should have been implemented instead of relying on temporary fixes.</li>
      <li>The vehicle struggled with weight distribution. Both engine and CVT were mounted behind the rear-axle, exhibiting instability due to a rear-heavy configuration. As a temporary measure, a thicker steel floor plate was installed to counterbalance the rear bias. </li>
